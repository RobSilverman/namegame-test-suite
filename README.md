Hi there! Welcome to my solutions for the WillowTree Software Testing project.

The assignment asks to:
- Verify the "streak" counter is incrementing on correct selections
- Verify the a multiple “streak” counter resets after getting an incorrect answer
- Verify that the correct counters are being incremented for tries and correct selections

Tests have been added for the above cases. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me by e-mail or phone.

The original readme.md file is included below the line break.

Have a great day!
